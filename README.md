# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis-Project

Domain:- Healthcare

Tools & Technologies:- Python(Jupiter Notebook), Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Power point

Overview:- This project aims to analyze medical data related to heart disease to uncover key metrics and factors that impact diagnosis. The analysis involves performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes on the heart disease dataset, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. Various data visualizations are created to compare heart disease rates by gender and age, as well as to identify significant relationships between attributes. The project also includes developing a dashboard with insightful visualizations and performing a detailed analysis to support future health and medical decision-making.

Key Features of this Project:-

ETL Process: Extract, transform, and load heart disease diagnostic data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data on heart disease rates by gender, age, and other factors using Python.
Data Visualization: Create meaningful visualizations and dashboards using Tableau or Power BI to highlight key findings.
Insights and Findings: Uncover key metrics to support healthcare decision-making.

Problem Statement:-

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation. You can perform EDA through python. The database extracts various information such as Heart disease rates, Heart disease by gender, by age. You can even compare attributes of the data set to extract necessary information. Make the necessary dashboard with the best you can extract from the data. Use various visualization and features and make the best dashboard Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes. Do your own research and come up with your findings.

The tasks to be done in the project:-

Performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key metrics, trends, and relationships in heart disease data, followed by creating insightful visualizations and dashboards using Python, Tableau, or Power BI to support healthcare decisions. This involves analyzing heart disease rates by gender, age, and other attributes, and identifying significant contributing factors.

Conclusion of the project:-

The conclusion of the Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis project is that through detailed analysis and visualizations, key factors contributing to heart disease were identified, such as age, gender, and other health indicators. By using data-driven insights, the project highlights patterns that can aid in early diagnosis and prevention strategies for heart disease. The visualizations and dashboards developed provide an accessible way to interpret complex medical data, ultimately supporting better healthcare decision-making and future planning for heart disease management.
